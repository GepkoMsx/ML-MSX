# ML-MSX
Assembly programming for the MSX2

## Goal
Make software for the MSX2 that works on any MSX2 with a diskdrive (MSX-DOS1), but also on MSX2 with expansions like SD cards, Harddrives etc. (MSX-DOS2). 
The final product(s) will be a DSK file with the program, game, etc. Setting up a library of common functions of code snippets, so software can be built faster. 

The product should be fully functional on standard hardware, meaning:
- It all fits on one 360kb floppy disk.
- Works on real hardware without midifcations
- Works with expansions, especially storage solutions (sd card, msx-dos2, nextor drives)

## Current Projects
- Learn the basics, building a library/toolbox.
- Build a game as excersize: The boardgame [Azul](https://www.nextmove-games.com/en/azul/).  (Buy the game if you like it!)
